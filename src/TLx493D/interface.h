/*!\file interface.h
 * \brief Generic Library interface to the peripheral drivers.
 *
 * The purpose of this file is to connect microcontroller
 * dependent functions to the generic TLx493D library which is
 * microcontroller agnostic. The functions specified below
 * are needed for the normal functioning of the sensor.
 *
 * In order to interface the the TLx493D (this library) to some microcontroller,
 * several functions need to be implemented and then they should be specified in
 * this file (interface.h). For example, in order to implement reading from the
 * I2C bus, which is needed by the library, a function like the following is required:
 * \code {.c}
 * int32_t I2C_read_device_specific(uint8_t addr, uint8_t *data, uint8_t count) {
 * 	int32_t status;
 *
 * 	// Read from I2C and assign status variable
 *
 * 	return status;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The this function should be specified below as such
 * \code {.c}
 * #define _I2C_read I2C_read_device_specific
 * \endcode
 * Please refer to the following #defines for information about the required implementation.
 *
 *
 * Note: ALL I2C functions should return a positive value of type int32_t (defined
 * in stdint.h) indicating some communication error or Zero(0) indicating
 * a successful communication. The positive return values themselves, aside from
 * indicating an error, are meaningless to the library and thus can be arbitrarily
 * chosen by the user as seen fit.
 * Negative return value are reserved and used internally by the generic library,
 * thus no function referred in this library should return a negative error as it
 * may collide with the library reserved return value! */
